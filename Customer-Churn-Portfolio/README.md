## Overview
Churn analysis by demographics, tenure, payment method, internet & add-on services.

## Key Findings
- **Churn Rate:** ~27% overall.
- **Tenure:** <12 months churn highest → early retention focus.
- **Payment:** **Month-to-month** contracts churn the most; **electronic check** highest among methods; bank transfer/mailed check lowest.
- **Services:** Fiber Optic churn higher (~42%) vs DSL (~19%); lack of security/backup/device protection increases churn up to ~50%.  
- **Streaming:** No streaming TV/movie add-ons → higher churn.

## Recommendations
- Push **auto-pay & multi-year** plans; incentives for month-to-month.
- Bundles (Fiber + Online Security or Streaming Add-ons) to increase stickiness.
- Senior-friendly support & simplified billing; prioritize first-year customers.

## Skills
Retention analytics, KPI design, executive insights, Excel dashboarding.
